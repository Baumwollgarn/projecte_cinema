# Cinedom
## Project LDM , BD & SI

Clone repository into folder with `git clone` and run the docker-compose.

Everything should just work as fine as it did on my machine.

# Build process:


We got the challenge to code front-end and the database by our own, including design guidelines for both of them.
Everything is built with Docker, it just takes a button press or a `docker-compose up` to get it running.

## Front-end

The website is created with plain HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript since we're not allowed to use any kind of frameworks. (SASS,React, etc.)
Concept of the website was a simple billboard application to get info about acutal movies, top rated movies and the cinemas where they're available.

## Back-end

The SQL diagram and design is following:

After we had the design for the database we got our hands on the website and its parts. We've seperated header, main and footer and made 2 main sites:
1. The billboard which includes the movies and cinemas fetched from the database
2. A form to add a cinema to the database. (It's not a PHP form, more like a JS function which fetches an insert.)


The NodeJS server using Express was made by Joan Galm√©s (our teacher), thanks for that part at this point :)

## FAQ:
Q: Where did you get all the information of the movies from?
A: We've just chosen random actual movies and copied the info from the internet and other sources.

Q: What's the actual use of this project?
A: Just to show off some skillz, ya know.

Q: Did you pass with this project?
A: I god damn hope so.



Any feedback is welcome !
