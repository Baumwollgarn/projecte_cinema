# Cinedom
## Project LDM , BD & SI

Clone repository into folder with `git clone` and run the docker-compose.

Everything should just work as fine as it did on my machine.

## Build process:

We got the challenge to code front-end and the database by our own, including design guidelines for both of them.
The SQL diagram and design is following:

After we had the design for the database we got our hands on the website and its parts. We've seperated header, main and footer and made 2 main sites:
1. The billboard which includes the movies and cinemas fetched from the database
2. A form to add a cinema to the database.

The NodeJS server using Express was made by Joan Galm√©s (our teacher), thanks for that part at this point :)

Any feedback is welcome !
